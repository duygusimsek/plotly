## Overview

### History of the Project

Many bacteria species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Some bacterial species can synthesize a protein that tastes like beef. Many labs have successfully synthesized meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on play roots. But the bacteria that will provide the perfect beef taste is still not found. To find that bacteria, a scientist studies the bacterias on the human belly button. 

### Purpose of this Project

The sample result of the navels of the people who participated in that research was analyzed. Each person’s identity was anonymous. They had been assigned an ID number. 

A dashboard was created and the results of the study were displayed to both the research participants and fellow researchers to access. [Click Here to Access the Dashboard](https://duygusimsek.github.io/plotly/)

## Results

Demographic information about the belly button bacterias was visualized for each volunteer. The volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their navels. 

A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) was created for that purpose. When an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage the bar chart had been adjusted according to the individual’s ID’s data. The bar chart displays the “sample_values” as the values, the “otu_ids” as the labels, and the “otu_labels” as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

A bubble chart was created to display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
* The “otu_ids” as the x-axis values.
* The “sample_values” as the y-axis values.
* The “sample_values” as the marker size.
* The “otu_ids” as the marker colors.
* The “otu_labels” as the hover-text values.

A gauge chart to displays the weekly washing frequency's value was created. When an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu, to display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart was provided.

Finally, the webpage and the dashboard were customized with the followings:

* An image was added to the jumbotron (header of the dashboard). To be able to do that “style.css” file was created and the code was placed inside that file. 
* Because of the selected jumbotron image, the header text’s color and paragraph’s color, and the font had changed to white. 
* The colors of the “Demographic info” panel, the horizontal bar chart, the bubble chart, and the gauge chart had been changed.
