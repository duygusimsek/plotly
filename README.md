## Overview

### History of the Project

Many bacteria species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Some bacterial species can synthesize a protein that tastes like beef. Many labs have successfully synthesized meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on play roots. But the bacteria that will provide the perfect beef taste is still not found. To find that bacteria, a scientist studies the bacterias on the human belly button. 

### Purpose of this Project

The sample result of the navels of the people who participated in that research was analyzed. Each person’s identity was anonymous. They had been assigned an ID number. 

A dashboard was created and the results of the study were displayed to both the research participants and fellow researchers to access. [Click Here to Access the Dashboard](https://duygusimsek.github.io/plotly/)

## Results

Demographic information about the belly button bacterias was visualized for each volunteer. The volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their navels. 

A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) was created for that purpose. When an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage the bar chart had been adjusted according to the individual’s ID’s data. The bar chart displays the “sample_values” as the values, the “otu_ids” as the labels, and the “otu_labels” as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
